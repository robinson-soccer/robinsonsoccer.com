Soccer jerseys will be provided to players before the first game of the season.  The cost of the jersey is included in the registration fee.  Individuals are responsible in providing their own shorts/pants and soccer socks.  Shinguards should always be worn under soccer socks to help keep them in place.  If game day is cold please try to wear extra layers under your jersey so players, referees and fans can see the team colors.

We'll have a jersey sample ready soon so check back here later!
