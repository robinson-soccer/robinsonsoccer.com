**When is soccer season?**

The fall soccer season begins registering in July.  Practices typically start in the middle of July and are recommend to continue at least once a week until the end of the season.  Games begin the first Saturday of September and continue for seven weeks ending in mid-October.  Games are always held on Saturday mornings.

**What does "U" mean in the age levels (ex. U6, U8, U10 and U13)?**

The "U" means "Under".  A U6 league would consist of players under the age of 6.

**What is our practice schedule and how long are they?**

Your coach should provide a practice schedule for families.  We recommend coaches have at least one practice a week for the duration of the season.  Practice times are up to the coaches.  Practices for younger players should be an hour or less while coaches of older players may practice up to an hour and a half.

**What should we bring to practice?**

Bring a ball if you have one. U6 and U8 teams play with a size 3 ball.  U10 and U13 teams play with a size 4 ball.  Coaches will have a bag of equipment with them but may not have enough balls for all players.  Cleats are preferred but not required to play or practice.  Shinguards are required for all practices and games.  Also bring plenty of water.

**Why are team benches and spectator seating on opposite sides of the field?**

In order for referees to best manage and keep teams and fans safe, distance and separation helps minimize problems.  Referees need to be able to see players awaiting to enter the game during a stoppage and players need to know when their coach is trying to communicate with them.  Nearly all soccer programs require spectators seating to be separate from spectator seating.  Please see our [field diagram](/youth/info/fields/) to better understand team and spectator seating.

**Why are there no goalies and 4 vs. 4 for U6 games?**

US Youth Soccer recommends players at this age to play "small sided games" if possible. This year we're lucky enough to have enough volunteer coaches to make smaller teams and play games with 4 vs. 4 and no goalies.  Small sided games allow young players to touch the ball more, have more play space, have more coaching attention and more opportunities to score goals.  Small sided games focus on young players having fun.

**Why are the games now being played at Washington Park instead of the City Park?**

Being located at Washington Park allows the Robinson Soccer program to keep growing.  At Washington Park we have room for two Beginner level fields, a Major level field and a Premier level field.  The extra space allows us to not have to use the baseball field so both soccer and baseball teams don't have to worry about being in each other's way.  If we keep growing we still have room for another field or two!

**What's going to happen to the fields at the City Park?**

We are currently using the former soccer space at the City Park as a junior high and high school practice field.

**What do the registration fees cover?**

Registration fees are used to purchase player jersey's and pay for game officials.

**What does team sponsorship money go towards?**

We are very thankful having great [sponsors](/youth/sponsors/) for Robinson Soccer! We use money raised through our sponsorship program to purchase new equipment such as soccer balls, nets, benches and safety equipment.

**Can I help?**

Sure!  We could always use your help! First, volunteering to coach is paramount in the success of this league and these kids!  We have provided some free [coaching resources](/youth/info/coaching/) from US Youth Soccer on our website.  We could also use volunteers to run the concession stand, which all profits go towards field renovations at the City Park.  We could use volunteers to help paint goals, paint fields, organize fundraisers... all kinds of things!  If you'd like to volunteer to help please [contact us](/youth/contact/).
