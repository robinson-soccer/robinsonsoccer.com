  We'd like to give thanks to all the team sponsors for their generosity!  With
  the help of our sponsors we've able to purchase equipment for the league
  including aluminum goals, portable benches, soccer balls, nets, corner flags,
  field paint, safety equipment and more.


  If you have any questions please contact us via the [contact page](/youth/contact/).
